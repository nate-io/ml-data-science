# Machine Learning Data Science With Python

Working through the excellent course [Complete Machine Learning and Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/). Note the course focuses on practical skills using the Python ecosystem of data science tools and is light on the math underpinning the data science field. However it does address a professional workflow to deliver real projects. 

As such it is a valuable pursuit focusing first on delivering product(s) through tool immersion with the notion it is important to deliver first and then step into learning the underlying math. In rough notes it is the online course version of the well-regarded [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).
